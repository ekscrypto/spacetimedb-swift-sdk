STATUS: Alpha -- Core features working but protocol implementation incomplete. Production use not recommended.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager (Xcode)

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** ‚Üí **Add Package Dependencies...**
2. In the search bar, paste the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/ekscrypto/spacetimedb-swift-sdk.git
   ```
3. Click **Add Package**
4. Choose the branch/version rule:
   - **Branch**: `main` (for latest updates)

5. Click **Add Package**
6. Select your app target when prompted to add the package products:
   - ‚úÖ `SpacetimeDB` (required)
   - ‚úÖ `BSATN` (required)
7. Click **Add Package**

### Swift Package Manager (Package.swift)

Add the dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [

    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "SpacetimeDB", package: "spacetimedb-swift-sdk"),
            .product(name: "BSATN", package: "spacetimedb-swift-sdk")
        ]
    )
]
```

### System Requirements

- **Swift**: 5.9 or later
- **Platforms**:
  - iOS 15.0+ / macOS 12.0+ (for Brotli compression support)
  - iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ (without compression)
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later (recommended)

## Sample Application: Quickstart Chat

This repository includes a fully functional chat application demonstrating SpacetimeDB integration with Swift. The sample implements the same features as the official Rust and TypeScript quickstart tutorials.

### Running the Chat Client

1. First, set up the SpacetimeDB server with the quickstart-chat module following the [official tutorial](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started)
2. Build and run the Swift client:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ./.build/debug/quickstart-chat
   ```

### Features

The Swift chat client implements all core features from the official tutorials, plus additional enhancements:

#### Core Features (matching Rust/TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time messaging** - Send and receive chat messages instantly
- ‚úÖ **User identity** - Automatic anonymous authentication with token persistence
- ‚úÖ **Name setting** - Change your display name with `/name <name>`
- ‚úÖ **Online presence** - Track when users join and leave
- ‚úÖ **Message history** - View recent messages when joining
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** - Prevents empty names and messages

#### Enhanced Features (Swift-specific)
- üéØ **Rename detection** - Shows "User X renamed to Y" notifications
- üéØ **Message distinction** - Your messages display differently from others
- üéØ **User listing** - `/users` command shows all online users
- üéØ **OneOffQuery support** - `--fetch-users-only` fetches all users without subscription
- üéØ **Subscription management** - `/sub` and `/unsub` commands for testing subscription lifecycle
- üéØ **Subscription readiness** - Waits for data sync before accepting commands
- üéØ **Token persistence** - Maintains identity across sessions (use `--clear-identity` to reset)
- üéØ **Automatic reconnection** - Reconnects with exponential backoff on connection loss
- üéØ **Debug mode** - Enable detailed logging with `--debug` flag

#### Available Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/name <name>` - Set your display name
- `/users` - List online users
- `/sub` - Subscribe to user and message updates
- `/unsub` - Unsubscribe from current subscription
- `/quit` - Exit the application
- Any other text sends a chat message

## Usage

### Creating Table Row Decoders

Before connecting to SpacetimeDB, you need to create decoders for your tables. See the **[Rust to Swift Conversion Guide](RUST_TO_SWIFT_GUIDE.md)** for detailed instructions on:
- Generating Rust module bindings
- Understanding type mappings
- Creating Swift table row decoders
- Handling optional fields and complex types

### Establishing a connection
```swift
import SpacetimeDB
import BSATN

let client = try SpacetimeDBClient(
  host: "http://localhost:3000", 
  db: "quickstart-chat",
  compression: .brotli,  // Default is .brotli, can also use .none
  debugEnabled: false    // Set to true for detailed logging
)

// Register table decoders
await client.registerTableRowDecoder(table: "user", decoder: UserRowDecoder())
await client.registerTableRowDecoder(table: "message", decoder: MessageRowDecoder())

// Connect with optional saved token and automatic reconnection
try await client.connect(
    token: savedToken,
    timeout: 10.0,  // Connection timeout in seconds
    delegate: myDelegate,
    enableAutoReconnect: true  // Enable automatic reconnection (default)
)
```

### Subscribing to tables
```swift
import SpacetimeDB

// Subscribe to multiple tables
let queryId = await client.nextQueryId
try await client.subscribeMulti(
    queries: ["SELECT * FROM user", "SELECT * FROM message"], 
    queryId: queryId
)

// Later, unsubscribe from the subscription
try await client.unsubscribe(queryId: queryId)
```

### Calling reducers
```swift
import SpacetimeDB
import BSATN

// Define a reducer
struct SetNameReducer: Reducer {
    let name = "set_name"
    let userName: String
    
    func encodeArguments(writer: BSATNWriter) throws {
        try writer.write(userName)
    }
}

// Call the reducer
let reducer = SetNameReducer(userName: "Alice")
let requestId = try await client.callReducer(reducer)
```

### Executing One-Off Queries
```swift
import SpacetimeDB

// Execute a single SQL query without subscription
let result = try await client.oneOffQuery("SELECT * FROM user", timeout: 30.0)

if let error = result.error {
    print("Query failed: \(error)")
} else {
    // Decode rows using registered table decoders
    let users: [UserRow] = await result.decodeRows(from: "user", using: client)
    
    for user in users {
        print("User: \(user.identity) \(user.name ?? "<unnamed>") \(user.online ? "online" : "offline")")
    }
}
```

3. **Single Subscriptions**: Cannot unsubscribe from single queries (only multi-query unsubscribe)
4. **Timers**: No support for server-side scheduled operations
5. **Non-String Map Keys**: Maps/Dictionaries with non-String keys need more testing

## Lessons learned

* **Why SpacetimeDB moved from Protobuf to BSATN**: The SpacetimeDB team abandoned Protobuf in favor of BSATN due to severe performance issues with the C# implementation, which introduced processing delays of up to 800ms in some scenarios. The extensive feature set of Protobuf made optimization difficult, leading to the development of BSATN as a simpler, more performant binary serialization format. (Source: [SpacetimeDB 0.11 release video](https://youtu.be/Z7MWdAEtv88?si=G65vvS1qiln7pub4))
* SATS-JSON supports 128-bit and 256-bit integer values which aren't supported by JSONDecoder and JSONSerialization.
* BSATN documentation is severely lacking, or at least not obvious and may require review of the Rust implementation to fully implement
* The "Quickchat Start" demo client makes uses of a the "connection_id" parameter which is marked as Internal and not to be used like this
* `tcpdump` utility has proven extremely useful in troubleshooting early connection issues
* The iOS URLSessionWebsocketTask only support "ws" and "wss" scheme, so database URLs starting with "http" and "https" have to be modified
* The SpacetimeDB server issues authentication token, or "Identity" anonymously to all requestors
* It isn't obvious how the authentication of user is expected to be done from a SpacetimeDB documentation's perspective
* Establishing an unauthenticated connection to the websocket always issues a new identity and authentication token by default
* ACL/permissions/authentication has to be performed by the reducers functions rather than the database connection itself
