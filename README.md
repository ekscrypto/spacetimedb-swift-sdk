# spacetimedb-swift-sdk
SDK to connect to SpacetimeDB from Swift

This is a community project and is not an official SDK supported by Clockwork Labs.
For more information about SpacetimeDB, visit https://spacetimedb.com

STATUS: Early development -- functional but not feature-complete.

## Installation

* Add https://github.com/ekscrypto/spacetimedb-swift-sdk.git to your Package Dependencies
* Select the app target to link against this SDK

## Sample Application: Quickstart Chat

This repository includes a fully functional chat application demonstrating SpacetimeDB integration with Swift. The sample implements the same features as the official Rust and TypeScript quickstart tutorials.

### Running the Chat Client

1. First, set up the SpacetimeDB server with the quickstart-chat module following the [official tutorial](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started)
2. Build and run the Swift client:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ./.build/debug/quickstart-chat
   ```

### Features

The Swift chat client implements all core features from the official tutorials, plus additional enhancements:

#### Core Features (matching Rust/TypeScript)
- âœ… **Real-time messaging** - Send and receive chat messages instantly
- âœ… **User identity** - Automatic anonymous authentication with token persistence
- âœ… **Name setting** - Change your display name with `/name <name>`
- âœ… **Online presence** - Track when users join and leave
- âœ… **Message history** - View recent messages when joining
- âœ… **Input validation** - Prevents empty names and messages

#### Enhanced Features (Swift-specific)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Rename detection** - Shows "User X renamed to Y" notifications
- ðŸŽ¯ **Message distinction** - Your messages display differently from others
- ðŸŽ¯ **User listing** - `/users` command shows all online users
- ðŸŽ¯ **Subscription readiness** - Waits for data sync before accepting commands
- ðŸŽ¯ **Token persistence** - Maintains identity across sessions (use `--clear-identity` to reset)

#### Available Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/name <name>` - Set your display name
- `/users` - List online users
- `/quit` - Exit the application
- Any other text sends a chat message

### Related Implementations

For comparison and reference, see the official SpacetimeDB quickstart tutorials:
- [Rust Tutorial](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started/rust-quickstart)
- [TypeScript Tutorial](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started/typescript-quickstart)

## Usage

### Establishing a connection
```swift
let client = SpacetimeDBClient(
  host: "http://localhost:3000", 
  db: "quickstart-chat")

// Register table decoders
await client.registerTableRowDecoder(table: "user", decoder: UserRowDecoder())
await client.registerTableRowDecoder(table: "message", decoder: MessageRowDecoder())

// Connect with optional saved token
let connectionId = try await client.connect(token: savedToken, delegate: myDelegate)
```

### Subscribing to tables
```swift
// Subscribe to multiple tables
try await client.subscribeMulti(
    queries: ["SELECT * FROM user", "SELECT * FROM message"], 
    queryId: 1
)
```

### Calling reducers
```swift
// Define a reducer
struct SetNameReducer: Reducer {
    let name = "set_name"
    let userName: String
    
    func encodeArguments(writer: BSATNWriter) throws {
        try writer.write(userName)
    }
}

// Call the reducer
let reducer = SetNameReducer(userName: "Alice")
let requestId = try await client.callReducer(reducer)
```

## Lessons learned

* SATS-JSON supports 128-bit and 256-bit integer values which aren't supported by JSONDecoder and JSONSerialization.
* BSATN documentation is severely lacking, or at least not obvious and may require review of the Rust implementation to fully implement
* The "Quickchat Start" demo client makes uses of a the "connection_id" parameter which is marked as Internal and not to be used like this
* `tcpdump` utility has proven extremely useful in troubleshooting early connection issues
* The iOS URLSessionWebsocketTask only support "ws" and "wss" scheme, so database URLs starting with "http" and "https" have to be modified
* The SpacetimeDB server issues authentication token, or "Identity" anonymously to all requestors
* It isn't obvious how the authentication of user is expected to be done from a SpacetimeDB documentation's perspective
* Establishing an unauthenticated connection to the websocket always issues a new identity and authentication token by default
* ACL/permissions/authentication has to be performed by the reducers functions rather than the database connection itself
