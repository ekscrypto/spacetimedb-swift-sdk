STATUS: Alpha -- Core features working but protocol implementation incomplete. Production use not recommended.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager (Xcode)

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** ‚Üí **Add Package Dependencies...**
2. In the search bar, paste the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/ekscrypto/spacetimedb-swift-sdk.git
   ```
3. Click **Add Package**
4. Choose the branch/version rule:
   - **Branch**: `main` (for latest updates)
   - **Version**: Use a specific version tag if available
5. Click **Add Package**
6. Select your app target when prompted to add the package products:
   - ‚úÖ `SpacetimeDB` (required)
   - ‚úÖ `BSATN` (required)
7. Click **Add Package**

### Swift Package Manager (Package.swift)

Add the dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ekscrypto/spacetimedb-swift-sdk.git", branch: "main")
]
```

Then add the products to your target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "SpacetimeDB", package: "spacetimedb-swift-sdk"),
            .product(name: "BSATN", package: "spacetimedb-swift-sdk")
        ]
    )
]
```

### System Requirements

- **Swift**: 5.9 or later
- **Platforms**:
  - iOS 15.0+ / macOS 12.0+ (for Brotli compression support)
  - iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ (without compression)
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later (recommended)

## Sample Application: Quickstart Chat

This repository includes a fully functional chat application demonstrating SpacetimeDB integration with Swift. The sample implements the same features as the official Rust and TypeScript quickstart tutorials.

### Running the Chat Client

1. First, set up the SpacetimeDB server with the quickstart-chat module following the [official tutorial](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started)
2. Build and run the Swift client:
   ```bash
   swift build
   ./.build/debug/quickstart-chat
   ```

### Features

The Swift chat client implements all core features from the official tutorials, plus additional enhancements:

#### Core Features (matching Rust/TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time messaging** - Send and receive chat messages instantly
- ‚úÖ **User identity** - Automatic anonymous authentication with token persistence
- ‚úÖ **Name setting** - Change your display name with `/name <name>`
- ‚úÖ **Online presence** - Track when users join and leave
- ‚úÖ **Message history** - View recent messages when joining
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** - Prevents empty names and messages

#### Enhanced Features (Swift-specific)
- üéØ **Rename detection** - Shows "User X renamed to Y" notifications
- üéØ **Message distinction** - Your messages display differently from others
- üéØ **User listing** - `/users` command shows all online users
- üéØ **Subscription readiness** - Waits for data sync before accepting commands
- üéØ **Token persistence** - Maintains identity across sessions (use `--clear-identity` to reset)
- üéØ **Automatic reconnection** - Reconnects with exponential backoff on connection loss
- üéØ **Debug mode** - Enable detailed logging with `--debug` flag

#### Available Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/name <name>` - Set your display name
- `/users` - List online users
- `/quit` - Exit the application
- Any other text sends a chat message

## Usage

### Establishing a connection
```swift
import SpacetimeDB
import BSATN

let client = try SpacetimeDBClient(
  host: "http://localhost:3000", 
  db: "quickstart-chat",
  compression: .brotli,  // Default is .brotli, can also use .none
  debugEnabled: false    // Set to true for detailed logging
)

// Register table decoders
await client.registerTableRowDecoder(table: "user", decoder: UserRowDecoder())
await client.registerTableRowDecoder(table: "message", decoder: MessageRowDecoder())

// Connect with optional saved token and automatic reconnection
try await client.connect(
    token: savedToken,
    timeout: 10.0,  // Connection timeout in seconds
    delegate: myDelegate,
    enableAutoReconnect: true  // Enable automatic reconnection (default)
)
```

### Subscribing to tables
```swift
import SpacetimeDB

// Subscribe to multiple tables
try await client.subscribeMulti(
    queries: ["SELECT * FROM user", "SELECT * FROM message"], 
    queryId: 1
)
```

### Calling reducers
```swift
import SpacetimeDB
import BSATN

// Define a reducer
struct SetNameReducer: Reducer {
    let name = "set_name"
    let userName: String
    
    func encodeArguments(writer: BSATNWriter) throws {
        try writer.write(userName)
    }
}

// Call the reducer
let reducer = SetNameReducer(userName: "Alice")
let requestId = try await client.callReducer(reducer)
```

### Test Coverage

The SDK includes unit tests for core components but lacks end-to-end protocol testing:

**‚úÖ Well Tested:**
- **BSATN Types**: All primitive types, arrays, products, and AlgebraicValues
- **Large Integers**: UInt128, UInt256, Int128, Int256 with JSON encoding
- **Core Messages**: IdentityToken, BsatnRowList, CompressibleQueryUpdate
- **Compression**: Unified compression enum with Brotli support
- **Message Handling**: BSATNMessageHandler with various message types

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Testing:**
- **Protocol Flow**: Connection lifecycle, subscription management
- **Error Recovery**: Network failures, malformed messages
- **Edge Cases**: Large messages, concurrent operations
- **Unimplemented Features**: Cannot test OneOffQuery, Unsubscribe, Events

### Known Limitations

1. **Gzip Compression**: Gzip compression is not supported (Brotli and uncompressed work)
2. **Large Messages**: No streaming support for very large messages
3. **Subscription Management**: Cannot unsubscribe from queries
4. **Timers**: No support for server-side scheduled operations
5. **Non-String Map Keys**: Maps/Dictionaries with non-String keys need more testing

## Lessons learned

* SATS-JSON supports 128-bit and 256-bit integer values which aren't supported by JSONDecoder and JSONSerialization.
* BSATN documentation is severely lacking, or at least not obvious and may require review of the Rust implementation to fully implement
* The "Quickchat Start" demo client makes uses of a the "connection_id" parameter which is marked as Internal and not to be used like this
* `tcpdump` utility has proven extremely useful in troubleshooting early connection issues
* The iOS URLSessionWebsocketTask only support "ws" and "wss" scheme, so database URLs starting with "http" and "https" have to be modified
* The SpacetimeDB server issues authentication token, or "Identity" anonymously to all requestors
* It isn't obvious how the authentication of user is expected to be done from a SpacetimeDB documentation's perspective
* Establishing an unauthenticated connection to the websocket always issues a new identity and authentication token by default
* ACL/permissions/authentication has to be performed by the reducers functions rather than the database connection itself
